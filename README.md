Here I have added basic working of arduino uno and node mcu.
First we go through the basics of blinking of led and varying intensity of les in arduino uno, and then playing with ultrasonic sensor, LCD display and DHT11 sensor. 
The code is supposed to be written in arduino IDE.
In the end a mini project is made using Node MCU which has an inbuilt wifi module which helps in transmitting data.
We connect DHT11 sensor and collect weather data, send this data to cloud via ThingSpeak platform and monitor various aspects of weather such as humidity and temperature.
The code is written in weather dectection using node mcu file.
Run this code in your IDE.
