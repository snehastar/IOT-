Here I have added a few basic project done through arduino uno and node mcu.
First we go through the basics of blinking of led and varying intensity of les in arduino uno. 
The code is supposed to be written in arduino IDE.
In the end a mini project it made usind Node MCU. 
The code is written in weather dectection using node mcu file.
Run this code in your IDE.
This is the link to the video about how this project works. https://photos.app.goo.gl/HozksCh93Y1BfKgs5
