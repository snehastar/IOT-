# IOT-
Here I have added a few basic project done through arduino uno and node mcu.
First we go through the basics of blinking of led and varying intensity of les in arduino uno. 
The code is supposed to be written in arduino IDE.
In the end a mini project it made usind Node MCU which has an inbuilt wifi module which helps in transmitting data.
We send this data to cloud via ThingSpeak platform and monitor varoiys aspects of data such as humidity and temperature.
The code is written in weather dectection using node mcu file.
Run this code in your IDE.
