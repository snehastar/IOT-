# IOT-
Here I have added a basic working of arduino uno and node mcu.
First we go through the basics of blinking of led and varying intensity of les in arduino uno. 
The code is supposed to be written in arduino IDE.
In the end a mini project is made using Node MCU which has an inbuilt wifi module which helps in transmitting data.
We send this data to cloud via ThingSpeak platform and monitor various aspects of data such as humidity and temperature.
The code is written in weather dectection using node mcu file.
Run this code in your IDE.
This is the link to the video about how this project works. https://photos.app.goo.gl/HozksCh93Y1BfKgs5
